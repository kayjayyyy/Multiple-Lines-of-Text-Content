# Multiple Lines of Text Content
A python program that will write multiple line of text contents into a text file mylife.txt. See sample output:

```
Enter line: Beautiful is better than ugly.
Are there more lines y/n? y
Enter line: Explicit is better than implicit. 
Are there more lines y/n? y
Enter line: Simple is better than complex. 
Are there more lines y/n? n
```
